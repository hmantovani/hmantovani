### Abalones Project - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Modeling

This is a project that uses the Abalones dataset as the foundation for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling. The Abalones dataset consists of detailed information about abalones, which are marine mollusks primarily found along the coast of Australia. This dataset contains physical measurements such as length, diameter, height, and weights of different parts of the abalone, along with the estimated age in the form of rings. Additionally, it includes information about the gender of the abalones. These data are often used in marine biology studies and statistical modeling to predict the age of abalones based on their physical characteristics. This dataset provides a valuable opportunity for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling.

#### Dataset description

The Abalones dataset contains information about the age of abalones, a type of mollusk, based on various physical measurements. Abalones are collected from the coast of Australia. The dataset includes the following columns:

- `Sex`: The sex of the abalone.
- `Length`: Length of the abalone (in mm).
- `Diameter`: Diameter of the abalone (in mm).
- `Height`: Height of the abalone (in mm).
- `Whole_weight`: Whole weight of the abalone (in grams).
- `Shucked_weight`: Shucked weight of the abalone (in grams).
- `Viscera_weight`: Viscera weight of the abalone (in grams).
- `Shell_weight`: Shell weight of the abalone (in grams).
- `Rings`: Number of rings (an estimate of age).

#### Project objectives

1. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand variable distributions, identify trends and outliers, and gain insights from the data.
2. Preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing/scaling numerical variables as needed.
3. Build and evaluate regression models to predict the age of abalones based on the provided information.
4. Document and share the results and source code in a GitHub repository.

#### Repository structure
