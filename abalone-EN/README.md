### Abalones Project - Predicting the Age of Abalones

Abalones, a type of marine mollusk, have been a valuable seafood resource for centuries. The age of an abalone is a crucial factor in determining its market value and sustainability for both ecological and economic reasons. The traditional method of age determination involves the labor-intensive process of counting growth rings on the shell, a technique that is not only time-consuming but also harmful to the abalone population. 

#### Why are we predicting Abalone age?

- **Economic value:** The seafood industry depends on the accurate determination of abalone age to establish appropriate pricing. Abalones are considered a delicacy in many cultures, and their age directly influences their market value. A precise predictive model can benefit both abalone producers and consumers by ensuring fair pricing.

- **Sustainability:** Sustainable harvesting practices are essential to protect marine ecosystems. Knowing the age of abalones allows for better management of populations and helps in setting catch limits. Predicting age without physical harm to abalones is a significant step toward responsible resource management.

- **Time and labor savings:** Traditional methods of age determination are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Automating this process through predictive modeling can save significant time and effort, making it a more efficient and cost-effective solution.

- **Environmental impact:** Reducing the need for invasive age determination methods can minimize the ecological impact on abalone populations. This is crucial for the conservation of these valuable marine creatures.

By developing a reliable predictive model for abalone age estimation, we can address both economic and ecological concerns, offering a more efficient, sustainable, and environmentally friendly solution for the seafood industry and marine conservation efforts.

#### Dataset description

The Abalones dataset contains information about the age of abalones, a type of mollusk, based on various physical measurements. Abalones are collected from the coast of Australia. The dataset includes the following columns:

- `Sex`: The sex of the abalone.
- `Length`: Length of the abalone (in mm).
- `Diameter`: Diameter of the abalone (in mm).
- `Height`: Height of the abalone (in mm).
- `Whole_weight`: Whole weight of the abalone (in grams).
- `Shucked_weight`: Shucked weight of the abalone (in grams).
- `Viscera_weight`: Viscera weight of the abalone (in grams).
- `Shell_weight`: Shell weight of the abalone (in grams).
- `Rings`: Number of rings (an estimate of age).
